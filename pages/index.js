              <br></br>
              As we all look upon these stars gaze,<br></br>
              we all tend to venture into who we are within a phrase. <br></br>
              Why this is we do not know, <br></br>
              but we feel the coldness as if its about to snow. <br></br>
              <br></br>
              This is not because we came and went,<br></br>
              the truth is that we were all bent. <br></br>
              Towards inside the true light lies, <br></br>
              although it stands between all of our eyes.<br></br>
              <br></br>
              Our bodies try to reach out, <br></br>
              but afraid, afraid the mind does shout. <br></br>
              This is not however out of disrespect, <br></br>
              like a firework, the launch needs time to collect.<br></br>
              Colour comes after in a mass of light, the energies start to shine
              through our lives. <br></br>
              <br></br>
              This does not couture naturally however not a test it happens
              gradually.
              <br></br>
              Some of us do this because we do not know the secret was inside of
              us waiting to flow.
              <br></br>
              We do this because we are scared of neglect the mind and the body
              trying to finally connect.
              <br></br>
              The explosion comes after like the big bang and then in the
              silence,
              <br></br> the cheers began.
